                <p>With more than 25 years of experience in precision screen printing, Central
                    Midori has continuously improved its printing techniques to achieve smaller
                    features on thinner material with high speed and accuracy. We process our
                    stencils internally using liquid emulsion or capillary film. Our most common
                    mesh is made of monofilament polyester but we also use stainless steel
                    for certain applications. Mesh count can vary from 100 to 420 thread per
                    in. CMI was a pioneer in the development of through-hole printing in the
                    early 1990's. All of our printing processes take place in clean rooms with
                    temperature and humidity control.</p>

                <p>At Central Midori we know how important colors are for our customers.
                    They represent your brand and stimulate the senses -- instantly conveying
                    a message like no other communication method. Colors mean different things
                    depending on your culture, geographical location or personal background.
                    We take color mixing seriously. You would be surprised by how long it takes
                    us to reach the perfect color mix.</p>
                <p>Halfway between a science and an art, mixing colors relies on long term
                    experience. We are also using one of the most sophisticated high precision
                    spectrophotometry to fine tune the formulation with a ΔE of 1.</p>
                <p>CMI has also developed an expertise in texture and surface pattern.</p>
                <p><em>Applying four color standards:</em> RAL, Pantone, NCS and DIC</p>
                <p>CMI also developed its own color library to guarantee repeatability.</p>
                <p><em>Finishes include:</em> gloss, matte, anti glare, anti-wear and embossed
                    printing effects.</p>
                <p>The following standard illuminants are available to choose from when measuring
                    color with our spectrophotometer: D65-10, D65-02, F02-10 (CWF)</p>

            <!-- EMBOSSING -->
            <article class="standard-article gray clearfix">
                 <h2>Embossing</h2>

                <img src="assets/services/assets/image-placeholder-500x500.jpg" class="medium pull-right"
                />
                <p>Traditionally, embossing heightens the key area of a graphic overlay or
                    a membrane switch.</p>
                <p>At Central Midori there are 5 major types of embossing, as follow:</p>
                 <h3>1- Heated Hard Tool Embossing</h3>

                <p>Using a customized male/female hard tool heated at around 85℃ the typical
                    height is 0.6mm+/- 0.1mm. Conventional polydomes are embossed that way
                    and can withstand more than 1million actuation cycles. The process is compatible
                    with graphic overlay and membrane switch, although special silver ink formulation
                    is required for the latter.</p>
                 <h3>2- Pillow and Rim Emboss</h3>

                <p>Performed with a male/female etched die at a lower temperature. Maximum
                    height is 0.3mm +/- 0.1.</p>
                 <h3>3- PIP Emboss</h3>

                <p>It consists of tiny embossed dimples typically used by people who are
                    blind or visually impaired (Braille).</p>
                 <h3>4- Multi-Height Embossing</h3>

                <p>This process requires an intricate tool of high geometric complexity and
                    a narrow process window. Multiple heights can be achieved through tight
                    process controls, the right substrate and ink formulation.</p>
                 <h3>5- Debossing</h3>

                <p>Debossing is defined as a negative embossing. At Central Midori we can
                    mount LED inside such formed cavity or depression.</p>
                <p>Either polyester and polycarbonate materials can be embossed. Polyester
                    prefered thickness range between 50 and 200µm while polycarbonate is more
                    readily embossed in thickness between 100 and 180µm.</p>

                 <h2>Lamination</h2>

                <div class="slider standard-slider-component small pull-left">
                    <img src="assets/capabilities/assets/lamination001.jpg" />

                </div>
                <p>Many of our products are manufactured by laminating multiple layers of
                    conductive and dielectric polymers together. The layers are held together
                    with high performance Pressure Sensitive Adhesive.</p>
                <p>The lamination process guarantees the proper bonding and protect the final
                    assembly from outside contaminants such as cleaners, detergents and solvent
                    and also from hostile conditions like high temperature, humidity and moisture.</p>
                <p>No heat is necessary during the lamination process and consequently no
                    thermal stress is applied to the product, which reduces thermal distortion.
                    Our maximum lamination size is 550 X 400mm.</p>

            <!-- COMPONENT MOUNTING -->
            <article class="standard-article gray clearfix">
                 <h2>Component Mounting</h2>

                <p>Central Midori assembly process consists of integrating electronic components,
                    such as passive components or LEDs into our products using conductive adhesive
                    technology. Our production process is made up of six stations.</p>
                <p>First is the dispensing of the chip bonding glue followed by the dispensing
                    of a low temperature conductive epoxy adhesive. We use Juki high speed
                    mounter to pick and place components at the rate of 19,300 per hour. Our
                    adhesives are cured at low temperature (65℃) in a ventilated oven. For
                    most of our applications a final component encapsulation is necessary to
                    meet customer peel strength requirement. The last operation consists of
                    the curing of the encapsulant.</p>
                <ul class="standard-list">
                    <li>Max panel size: 400 X 360mmlow temperature component pick and place.jpg</li>

                 <h3>Termination and connector assembly</h3>

                <p>ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) connectors have become a popular solution.
                    The connector is on the side of the board only. Our most common pitches
                    are 1mm, 1.25mm, 1.27mm and 2.54mm</p>
                <p>Insulation Displacement Connectors (IDC), also known as crimped connectors,
                    are widely used in our industry. The contacts crimp through the dielectric
                    material into the copper conductor. Housings are assembled after crimping.
                    Central Midori offers a wide variety of crimped connectors including Nicomatic,
                    FCI/Berg and Tyco/Amp.</p>

                 <h3>Dome assembly</h3>

                <p>Tactile domes are sandwiched between the circuit and the overlay layer.
                    A spacer layer holds the domes in their positions. Domes come in various
                    shapes (i.e. square, round, triangle and oblong). The material can be stainless
                    steel or plated with gold or Nickel. Diameters vary from 6 to 20mm.</p>
