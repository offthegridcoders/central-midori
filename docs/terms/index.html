                <p>The sale of products (“Products”) and the provision of services (“Services”)
                    by Central-Midori (Int’L) Pte Ltd (“Seller” or “Company”) are subject to
                    these Standard Terms & Conditions of Sale (these “Conditions”), to the
                    exclusion of Purchaser’s terms and conditions, including any terms and
                    conditions subject to which any quotation of Seller is accepted or any
                    order of Purchaser is made. Any order by Purchaser to purchase Products
                    or for the performance of Services shall constitute Purchaser’s assent
                    to these Conditions.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p class="header">Orders</p>
                        <p>Orders for Products or Services (“Order”) shall be in writing or if given
                            orally, must be confirmed in writing by Purchaser.</p>
                        <p>All Orders placed by Purchaser are subject to written confirmation by
                            Seller’s authorised representative. Orders may not be cancelled or rescheduled
                            without Seller’s prior written consent and except and on terms that Purchaser
                            shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless against all loss of profits, costs,
                            damages, charges and expenses incurred by Seller as a result of such cancellation
                            or rescheduling. Purchaser is responsible for: (a) the accuracy of its
                            Order and (b) furnishing to Seller any necessary information relating to
                            the Products and Services to enable Seller to supply them in accordance
                            with these Conditions.</p>
                        <p>If the Products are to be manufactured or any process is to be applied
                            to the Products by Seller in accordance with any specification submitted
                            by Purchaser in the Order, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller free
                            from and against all actions, proceedings, claims, demands, obligations,
                            liabilities, loss, damage, costs and expenses (including full legal costs
                            and expenses) which may have accrued or been awarded against Seller in
                            respect of any claim for infringement of any patent, copyright, design,
                            trade mark or other industrial, proprietary or intellectual property rights
                            of any third parties which result from Seller’s use of the specifications
                            submitted by Purchaser.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="header">Delivery</p>
                        <p>The Company shall use all reasonable endeavours to deliver the Products
                            or Services on the date and at the location specified in the Order.</p>
                        <p>However, the date of delivery is only an estimate and the Company shall
                            not be liable for any loss or damage arising directly or indirectly from
                            delay in delivery. Any such delay shall not entitle Purchaser to cancel
                            any Order or refuse to accept delivery of any or all of the Products comprised
                            in the relevant Order. Upon delivery (or deemed delivery) to Purchaser
                            at the delivery location designated, the risk in the Products and Services
                            supplied by the Company shall pass to Purchaser. If Purchaser delays in
                            taking or refuses to take delivery for any reason whatsoever, shipments
                            shall be deemed delivered to Purchaser upon Seller’s delivery to the designated
                            delivery location and notice being given to Purchaser of such delivery.</p>
                        <p>Delivery may be made in partial shipments or installments.</p>
                        <p>If Purchaser causes interruption or delay of Seller’s contractual performance,
                            or refuses to or are unable for whatever reason to take delivery of the
                            Products and Services duly delivered to it, Purchaser shall be liable to
                            bear all consequential costs and expenses incurred thereby, including but
                            not limited to costs and expenses of warehouse storage and insurance.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p class="header">Prices</p>
                        <p>The prices of the Products and Services are those specified in Seller’s
                            invoice for the relevant Products.</p>
                        <p>Quotations are valid for the period as specified in the quotation. Unless
                            otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller, all prices quoted are exclusive
                            of transportation, customs, insurance and other costs, duties, and charges
                            and all taxes whether imposed in Singapore or elsewhere (collectively,
                            “Taxes and Costs”) including, but not limited to, Goods and Services Tax
                            or Value Added Tax. Purchaser agrees to pay all Taxes and Costs unless
                            Seller agrees in writing that the sale of the Products and Services is
                            exempted from the payment of any Taxes and Costs. Purchaser shall provide
                            all necessary assistance as Seller may require in any proceedings concerning
                            the collection of any Taxes and Costs, and provide Seller with the necessary
                            documentation. Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold Seller harmless for
                            any liability for Taxes and Costs in connection with the sale of the Products
                            and Services, including the collection or withholding thereof, and the
                            penalties and interest thereon.</p>

                        <p class="header">Payment</p>
                        <p>Seller’s terms of payment for the Products and Services are 30 days (unless
                            otherwise agreed by Seller in writing) from the date of Seller’s invoice.
                            All payments shall be in Singapore Dollars or the currency stated in Seller’s
                            invoice. Time of payment of the price shall be of essence.</p>
                        <p>Payment shall be made by cash/irrevocable letter of credit (“L/C”)/cheque/bank
                            draft/telegraphic transfer (unless otherwise agreed by Seller in writing),
                            provided that Purchaser shall give Seller prior written notice of Purchaser’s
                            chosen mode of payment. Payment made by L/C, cheque or bank draft must
                            be confirmed by or drawn against (as the case may be) a bank in Singapore.
                            Purchaser shall bear all bank charges and any other costs and expenses
                            in connection with payment for the Products and Services. If any payment
                            is not made when due, the Company shall be entitled, without prejudice
                            to any other rights or remedies available to the Company, to charge interest
                            for late payment from the due date of payment until the actual date of
                            full payment (both before and after judgment) at the rate of 1.5% per month.
                            Payment shall be deemed to have been made on the day the payment is credited
                            to Seller’s account, or, in the case of cheques and bank drafts, on the
                            day on which they are cleared upon presentment for payment.</p>
                        <p>Seller may set off any claims it may have against Purchaser against claims
                            for payment which Purchaser may have against Seller.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p class="header">Retention of Title</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding delivery of the Products, title to the Products shall
                            not pass from Seller to Purchaser until Purchaser has fully paid Seller
                            the total purchase price of the Products and no other sums whatsoever are
                            due from Purchaser to Seller. Until such time as title in the Products
                            passes to Purchaser: (a) Purchaser shall hold the Products delivered as
                            Seller’s fiduciary agent and bailee, and shall keep the same separate from
                            other goods or property of Purchaser and of third parties, properly stored,
                            protected, insured, and identified as the property of Seller; (b) Purchaser
                            shall not be entitled to pledge, mortgage or charge, or create any form
                            of security interest or encumbrance in respect of any Products so delivered
                            and shall further keep the same free from distress, execution, or any other
                            legal process levied against Purchaser or any other person; and (c) Seller
                            shall be entitled at any time to (i) exercise its lawful rights of lien,
                            retention, or stoppage in transit as unpaid seller, and (ii) require Purchaser
                            to forthwith deliver up the Products to Seller, and if Purchaser fails
                            to do so, Seller may enter upon any premises where such Products are situated
                            and repossess the same, and where such Products are situated on the premises
                            of a third party, Purchaser shall secure rights of access to such premises
                            so that Seller may lawfully enter therein and repossess the same. Purchaser
                            shall furnish Seller with all relevant information about the location of
                            the Products, provide all necessary assistance as Seller shall require,
                            and reimburse Seller for any costs and expenses incurred by Seller in securing
                            its title thereto.</p>
                        <p>If for any reason reservation or retention of title is not permitted by
                            the applicable law, Seller shall be entitled to demand that Purchaser provide
                            Seller with any other form(s) of security available at law to Seller, and
                            Purchaser shall undertake all measures necessary and legally permissible
                            to secure Seller’s claims to the Products, and to notify Seller immediately
                            if third parties assert claims, liens or charges which endanger Seller’s
                            title thereto.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="header">Notification of Defects/Acceptance</p>
                        <p>Purchaser shall perform whatever inspection or tests Purchaser deems necessary
                            as promptly as possible but in any event within seven (7) days from delivery
                            (or deemed delivery, as the case may be). Any externally visible damage
                            or defect in the Products or Services or discrepancy in shipment quantity
                            must be notified in writing to the Company within seven (7) days from delivery
                            (or deemed delivery) of the Products and Services. Thereafter, Purchaser
                            will be deemed to have accepted all Products and Services delivered (or
                            deemed delivered), the Products will be deemed conclusively complete, conforming,
                            and free of any externally visible defect or damage, and the invoice will
                            be considered correct for payment.</p>
                        <p>Any other damage or defect in the Products or Services (e.g., internal
                            or latent damage or defects) must be notified in writing to the Company
                            immediately but in any event within fourteen (14) days from Purchaser’s
                            discovery thereof, such that Seller may stop production and investigate
                            the nature of non-conformance or defects.</p>
                        <p>Failure to notify Seller in accordance with this Clause 6 will release
                            Seller from liability under Clause 7 (Warranty).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="header">Warranty</p>
                        <p>Seller warrants that all Products and Services provided to Purchaser shall
                            conform to the applicable specifications as agreed with Purchaser and shall
                            be free from material defects in material, workmanship and title for a
                            period of 12 months from the date of delivery (or deemed delivery).</p>
                        <p>Provided that Purchaser complies with the notification requirement under
                            Clause 6 (Notification of Defects/Acceptance), if any Product or Service
                            is found to be materially defective, the Seller’s only obligation shall
