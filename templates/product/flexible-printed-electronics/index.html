      <p><em class="dropcase">W</em>ith over 25 years of experience, Central Midori is recognized
        in Asia as an expert in design, engineering and manufacturing
        of customized membrane switches. Membrane switch is one
        of the most cost effective and reliable Human Machine
        Interface. It is screen-printed on polyester and polycarbonate
        film using conductive ink and UV curable dielectric.
        <br/><br/>
        Many of our customers come to us with a vague description
        of the application. The role of our engineers is to work
        closely with the customers to review the requirements,
        to design together the most cost effective solution and
        to manufacture a few proof-of-concept prototypes. When
        the customer is satisfied and the design is frozen, we move
        to a full scale qualification using production equipment and a
        complete report is submitted to the customer. Upon final approval
        the project transitions to production.
        <br/><br/>
        Central Midori offers non-tactile constructions (without direct
        sensitive feedback) - or tactile solutions with metal domes and
        polydomes, which provide immediate tactile response. A polydome
        can be designed (i.e. diameter and height) to meet the actuation
        force and the switch travel distance required by the application.
        Metal domes come in different shapes and sizes with actuation forces
        from 170 to 420 grams and travel distances typically
        from 0.178 to 0.89mm.</p>
