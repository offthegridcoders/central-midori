        <p>We are offering thin and flexible solutions for the illumination of your human-machine Interface.</p>
        <p>As you cannot place a discreet LED below each dome switch, light guide films are designed to
        provide a uniform illumination with a minimum number of LEDs.</p>
        <p>CMI have developed a unique technology which consists of a thin flexible material with printed dots
        arranged in a particular pattern.</p>
        <p>The base film provides high transparency along with high flexibility while the printed ink diffuses the
        light effectively.</p>
        <p>The side firing LEDs are mounted along one or more edges of the light guide film. The unreflected
        light travels through the film until it gets diffused in the dot printed area.</p>
        <p>Not all applications require thin material and CMI has also developed a PMMA light guide panel. The
        transparent acrylic material can be directly CO2 laser-engraved with microstructures or printed with
        ink dots (similar to the light guide film).</p>
        <p>PMMA typical thicknesses vary from 1mm to 3mm while we recommend a thin film of 250Âµm.</p>
