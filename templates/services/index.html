        <h2>Conceptual Design</h2>
        <p><span class="drop-case">I</span>n the early stage of a new product development CMI provides design assistance, engineering
          support, and cost/value analysis. Just a few of our customers have the necessary expertise to
          optimize their designs by using the full capability of our technologies. Tactile feel is not just about
          selecting a dome, force sensing is not only about ink formulation, minor changes to the design have
          tremendous implications to your product functionalities and CMI engineers are here to help you
          make the right decisions in the initial phase.</p>
        <p>CMI also provide technical expertise in Printed Electronic to R&amp;D engineers to enable and enhance
          performance in 3 strategic areas:</p>
        <ul class="standard-list">
          <li><em>Flexibility/Elasticity:</em> curvable, bendable, foldable, rollable, conformal, stretchable</li>
          <li><em>Miniaturization/Portability:</em> Integration of more technology into less material and space
            (thinner, lighter, smaller)</li>
          <li><em>Security:</em> anti tamper mesh circuitry</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rapid Prototyping</h2>
        <p><span class="drop-case">T</span>he lean start-up methodology to develop new products requires many design iterations followed by
          many prototypes. CMI has established a Development Centre with dedicated resources to build
          proof of concept prototype in a record time. The majority of the manufacturing processes in the
          development centre is digital and hence do not require expensive/long lead-time tooling. The
          personnel of the Development Centre was selected among the most experienced and skilled
          engineers.</p>
