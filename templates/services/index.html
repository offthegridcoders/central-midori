        <h2>Conceptual Design</h2>
        <p><span class="drop-case">I</span>n the early stages of a new product development, many customers do not have the expertise to optimize their designs. And because minor changes to the design may have tremendous implications on product functionality, Central Midori engineers are here to help you make the right decisions in the initial phase. We offer design assistance, engineering support and cost/value analysis.</p>
        <p>Central Midori also provide technical expertise in Printed Electronic to R&D engineers to enable and enhance performance in 3 strategic areas:</p>
        <ul class="standard-list">
          <li><em>Flexibility/Elasticity:</em> curvable, bendable, foldable, rollable, conformal, stretchable</li>
          <li><em>Miniaturization/Portability:</em> Integration of more technology into less material and space (thinner, lighter, smaller)</li>
          <li><em>Security:</em> anti tamper mesh circuitry</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rapid Prototyping</h2>
        <p><span class="drop-case">W</span>e employ the lean startup methodology to develop products by iterating on design followed by  prototyping. We have established a Development Centre with dedicated resources to build proof-of-concept prototypes in record time. The majority of the manufacturing processes in the development centre is digital and hence do not require expensive lead-time tooling. Our personnel are among the most experienced and skilled engineers in the industry.</p>
